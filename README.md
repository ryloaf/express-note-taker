# Express.js Note Taker App

  ## Description

  This application allows the user to write and save notes and uses an Express.js back end. Starter code for the front end was provided, so my job was to build the back end and deployed the app to Render.
  
  ## Usage

  1. Open integrated terminal with server.js.
  2. Enter 'node server.js' in the the command line.
  3. Click the server link presented in the terminal.
  4. Click "Get Started" to be directed to the notes page.
  5. Write down your notes in the text box and click the "save" button.
  6. If you'd like to delete a note, click the trash icon.
